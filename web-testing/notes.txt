What am I listening for?
- identification?
  - might that be a bit contradictory to ecological thought? to think of these weather events as distinct/identifiable and individual occurrences?
  - how to think of weather not as 'Nature'?
  ethereal quality of sound -
- high-level abstracted inputs?
- or maybe high-level abstractions paired with weather data
  - weather on different scales of time; listening will likely be fast/reactive
  - longer duration depicted by weather forecast in that area
- what happens when nothing is really being heard by the device? Windless, sunny day - how do you resonify that?


What is aesthetic direction of the mappings?
- Both in how things are mapped and how it sounds more generally
- ie. performance of mapping things and sonic/visual results
- Ironically map to 'Nature' sounds -

What does the mediating role of the phone and algorithms, the interactive/participatory part of it, and generally my system imply about the situation more broadly, what aesthetic decisions does it suggest?
- piece wouldn't exist without these 'strange strangers' participating/joining (truly would be no material for sound)

What about weather am I trying to communicate or explore?
- Morton's 'consciousness' of the mesh
  - relationality
  - doing away with Nature (Nature at odds with interconnectedness, 99)
- Morton and algorithm - set algorithm in play and see what happens - chaos


Nature not just a 'thing' that happens - just like economy - we have agency and impact within it...


breaking of weather patterns that we expect force us to 'denature Nature' - to appreciate how 'Nature' isn't really this thing that always happens a certain way according to essential laws/rules - not to adopt laissez-faire attitudes towards it's existence and our involvement in it. Aesthetic of 'unsettling' weather patterns?


don't have to subscribe right away to what Morton is saying. There's an interesting tension between his doing away with Nature and Schaeffer's conservation of it

Sound/Listening
- reduced listening - non-referential and ecological thought/hyperobject
- non-referential
  - de-organelling (deconstructing) Nature as an entity itself into component (sound) parts as we perceive them (nature denatured) (concatenative synthesis is appropriate - many enmeshed grains opposed to one or a few large organs)
  - supplementing one human method of reasoning about the world; to understand existence via causality (cause and effect -> this thing caused the sound - referential) with another (albeit somewhat human-centered); qualities of our perception (a phenomenological reading?)
  - In other words, the shift from referential listening to reduced listening (whereby the listener's (by saying 'listener's' do I avoid a contradiction of aligning with humanism or does this need more thought?) perception and existence is entangled in the existence of the sound) is a similar sort of shift as the process of 'denaturing Nature' -> shifting from thinking of Nature as this concrete standalone entity other than us towards an understanding of that phenomena as something we are a part of and necessarily involved in.
  - ^ the above is wrong:
    - ecological listening (if I should call it that) needs both reduced and referential listening - reduced so not to objectify nature (or other sound objects) as single and separate (unrelated to the listener) but also referential, so not to deny their existence (which would be anti-post-humanist, and contra to the OOO underpinning the ecological thought)
- how does reduced listening resonate (or not) with ecological thought?
- sound as hyperobject?
- sound is relational, enmeshed, interconnected, ecological?
  - most Western music: sound concepts are entirely relational - scales most fundamentally denote relations between notes, rhythm - relations in time, timbre - relation in instrumentality, etc...


- different streams for different aspects of the weather that are being sent to the concatenative synthesizer at once.


So what am I listening for?
  - things that identify weather: wind, precipitation, thunder, ...
  - qualities of the sound that move away from 'nature things'
  - Semantic one-shot words that lean towards weather sounds but aren't weather-related.
    - 'sputter', trickle,
    - 'darkness'/'brightness'
    -
    - we don't need to understand weather as just 'precipitation, cloud coverage, wind, thunder, etc...' (also avoiding embarrassing miscategorization)

Thinking big - p. 30
- 'End of the World' -> Loss of our reference for things. Since everything is interconnected, everything has meaning, which suggests nothing has meaning and the task of discerning what is meaningful is even more difficult (kirkegaard lost in infinite?)
- 'we know less as we know more' - that 'strange stranger' quality of the mesh
- this has been an enormous task for scientific models that predict climate; what to include in a model, what to exclude...
- OOO and related ontologies of connectivity encourages us to 'think big' but interconnectedness is entangled with chaos (the butterfly effect) - how can we think big without descending into chaos?
  - art?
    - providing points of entry - a fabricated 3rd person perspective of things as an 'audience member' or 'player' - to view a simplified version of chaos or entanglement. In other words - perspective (the game 'Everything') - audience has perspective of other weather systems around world. Co-located audience has perspective through a number of different displays and speakers.
  - collectively - Morton's digression of collective over community...
  - SO: this piece is an experimentation of how art can confront the daunting task of thinking big and thinking ecologically. Thinking beyond ourselves (post-human)


What is weather
- water, temperature, altitude, atmosphere, solar winds, earth's magnetism, ozone, particles
- just a human understanding of patterns of motion of energy?
- what does that do for us - appreciating weather as a deeply enmeshed hyperobject? (does it have to do anything to be significant/worthy of artistic inquiry? maybe that's the question?)
  - we realize our agency within it (ie. we don't fall into the laissez-faire attitude towards Nature)
  -



Read Morton's book - about ecology (not really about post-humanism, hyperobjects, or )
- key argument was for Ecology Without Nature - denaturing Nature - de-'othering' nature and appreciation of interconnectedness and the mesh
- argues that 'Nature' rhetoric debilitates our capacity to act in the current climate crisis: view of nature as 'a thing that will happen regardless of our intentions' - laessez-faire attitudes, or a depreciation for how things are connected

- interesting tension between what he is saying (his view of ecology) and Schaeffer's writings which are very much in the interest of conservation of nature - in that it reifies this divide between man-made and nature

- those articulations in sound - privileging of 'nature' sounds in acoustic ecology, tarnishing of 'industrial' and 'noisey'

- referential also 'human-centered' - we're still central to it -
- happens anyway - we're used to telescoped views of maps - to experience multiple spaces in real time

what aesthetic direction might this suggest both for machine listening and for re-sonification?
- listening:
  - direct recognition of things -> suggests a sort of 'referential listening' which aligns with OOO (this sound exists outside of our perception of it) but also perhaps suggests something 'organed off' about what is being listened to (a contradiction with Morton (and 50000 other writer's) 'interconnectedness' ideas)
    - thinking of weather as some 'object' to be listened to is somehow contradictory to the idea that everything and co-productive
  - or maybe 'semantic layer 3' things that are suggestive of how 'weather' sounds
    - 'sputter', 'howl', etc... (are these too abstract for an audience to understand?)
    - tie that in with local weather information to make it still about weather on some scale?
- resonification:
  - abstract, acousmatic -> translation of the 'referential' into something more 'ethereal' and 'enmeshed'
  - ironic resonification as things that are 'naturey'?



- skeptical that philosophical things could ground in any specific way a creative decision about mapping
  - set up of the piece is really more about the Morton
  - art speak of rightwing commentators -
- feeds your subconscious - to be compelling as art, come from immersion in the medium. what's more engaging - the thing you feel and experience as such in testing or the thing you embedd from some philosophical reading and hope it sounds good?
- tending away from categorization/identification
- breaking things down into spectrum of freq's. FFT european world view capitalism - find critiques of .  Other ways of spectrum;
- Tera Rodgers
  - FFT is a way of thinking of sound in a particular way.
  - SuperCollider butterfly behaviours
  - @reading:"The Poetics of Signal Processing"
    - connection to Derrida to 'on gramatology' - deconstructive reading of Claude Levi-Strauus (@read"The Raw and the Cooked" (brico)) and Rousseau - complicated nexus of ideas around 'Nature' and 'Culture' - connection with 'Bricoleauge'
- Steve Goodman - co-existing frequency a model for understanding everything.
- spectral analysis a really common thing - why choosing spectrum as a way of breaking things down
- Derrida - deconstruction - decide to do it 'uncertainly' - do it but not with confidence - do it because you're not sure what else to do (bearing reflection) recognizing it's specificity and shortcomings
- can position, frame, critique 'spectrum'

- spectrum is never just the 'spectrum' - constructed in some way - am I using FFT? or other spectral separators by filterbanks?
- spectrum doesn't have to mean FFT - just something where you decompose the spectrum
- MFCC another
- filtering with enveloping
- spectrum suggests size of things

- infrasonic zone - don't trust things that are super low or super high registering -
- infrasonic maybe of thigns that are analyzed already - fft of fft - "envelope extraction" a low frequency signal
- bottom and top not same - low frequencies we tend to call 'rhythms or timbre's or envelopes'
- but top - we just don't hear


- How much can you avoid human perception/scale?
- Is posthuman about erasing human scale? or more humbly about being less certain?
- Derrida - deconstruction - criticizing arbitrariness of european models of how world workds, while at the same time working within those models but more humbly and with less arrogance hopefully
- Adorno - 'second nature' - similar argument to Morton - 'mystification of nature' - nature thoroughly run through with 'culture'
- Derrida -

- what is the corpus?
  - natural recordings / soundscape composition mixed with (?) metallic and synthesized (heterogenous)
  - voices?
  - industrial or urban soundscapes?

- what will be live coded? what is the performance?
  - people connecting, their inherent presence
  - spatialization - sending around room
  - changing weighting of concatenative synthesis parameters
  - amalgamating and deconstructing remote participant's data streams- averaging, differencing, scaling, etc...
  - zooming in and out - start super zoomed in (can only see hamilton maybe to start)
  - *swapping out of corpus under the feet of the performance?
    - zils and patchet 2001 (musical mosaicing) - problem or difficulty of exploring enormous databases of samples
    - imagine suddenly swapping to the dirt sample library at a live coding show?
    - multiple perspectives on same input data
    - synthesized database and soundscape recordings
    - allows 'form' to emerge too - exploration of different


- How are they indexed?
- How are units stored? What database?
  - JSON if supported with SC would be easily transferred to client js

- could you just map the distance of the input location to the things around it and find the sample closest to it?
  - define a search space around the target - check all things inside that search space for their proximity, and select the closest one?
  - if nothing exists in the search space maybe there's silence? or search space grows?



  1. Random initialization :
    The sequencing starts with an initial sequence built up from a
    set of samples taken randomly in the predefined domains,
    evaluates all the constraint costs related to the current
    sequence, and computes the global cost that has to be
    minimized,
  REPEAT
  2. Compute all non-tabu variables costs:
    i.e. the segments costs related to each sample of the
    sequence,
  3. Select the highest-cost variable :
    Selection of the ‘worst’ segment that induces the highest
    constraint cost, i.e. that is the most responsible for the
    distance between the current musaic and the desired
    sequence,
  4. Search for the value inducing the lowest global cost:
    Browse the database of samples in order to find whether
    another sample that better fits the constraints could replace
    the ‘worst’ segment, and consequently diminish the
    constraints costs and the distance from the desired sequence,
  5. If the global cost cannot be improved, mark Vh as ‘tabu’:
    If the sample can not be replaced to improve the sequencing,
    this significates that the current configuration of the sequence
    does not allow to obtain a better local result around this
    segment, so the ‘worst’ segment is marked as ‘tabu’. That
    means that the segment can not be selected as the ‘worst’
    segment for a few iterations, during which the sequence
    configuration can change,
    6. If all the variables are tabu, random reinitialization:
      If all segments are ‘tabu’, the sequence has reached a stable
      local minimal cost configuration depending on the initial
      random sequence, and no changes of the samples can
      improve the sequencing: a new random initial samples
      sequence is computed. Indeed, as the process is very quick,
      we can repeat the “adaptive search” algorithm several times,
      by taking at each time a new random initial sequence,

UNTIL the global cost is lower than a predefined threshold, or
the maximum number of iterations is reached. The final musaic is
the best sequence of all these attempts, i.e. the sequence that has
the lowest final global cost.
