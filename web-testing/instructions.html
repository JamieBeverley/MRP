<h1 style='text-align:center'>Cumulonimbus</h1>
<div class="slideshow-container">

  <div class="instructionBlock">
    <p>
      Cumulonimbus is an interactive web installation and performance that seeks to explore the acoustic qualities of weather phenomena through machine listening and re-sonification.
      <br></br>
      People anywhere in the world are invited to lend their smartphones to extract sonic features from the weather in their local environment and listen to a re-sonification of that data. You can choose to listen to re-sonifications of other active users' weather through a map interface. During a performance of Cumulonimbus, live-streamed sound features will be used as material for musical improvisation performed in front of a live audience and streamed back to your smartphone.
      <br></br>
      Cumulonimbus seeks to foster a greater appreciation for, and understanding of, the elusive phenomena of global weather systems through participatory sound art.
      <br></br>
      Please review the following instructions before participating. These instructions can be returned to at any time.
     </p>
  </div>

  <div class="instructionBlock">
    <h3>Setup</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Bring your phone and headphones to an area where you have internet access and can hear sounds created by weather (rain, hail, thunder, or a quieter ambiance of a sunny or snowy day).
      </li>
      <li>
        Please do not enter dangerous weather areas for this piece. Weather can be listened to from a window or sheltered area, and more dramatic weather sounds do not necessarily translate to more spectacular re-sonifications!
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="instructionBlock">
    <h3>Listening</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Plug in your headphones (to avoid feedback) and select from the 'Listen' drop-down menu the source you would like to listen to.
      </li>

      <li>You can listen to 3 different re-sonifications:
        <ol>
          <li>Listen to a re-sonification of your own weather environment. Your phone will extract sonic features of the weather in your immediate environment and resynthesize new sounds from them.</li>
          <li>Listen to a re-sonification of another user's weather environment. Each point on the map corresponds to an active user in that approximate location, tap on a point to hear a re-sonification of the features streamed by that user.</li>
          <li>If a performance of Cumulonimbus is in progress somewhere in the world, you can listen to a live-performed stereo re-sonification of the weather data shared by other connected users.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Hit the (ðŸ”Š) icon to listen/mute.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <div class="instructionBlock">
      <h3>Sharing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Hit 'Share' to allow users to listen to re-sonifications of your weather environment.</li>
        <li>Your phone will stream the extracted sound features of your immediate environment (not the sound itself) to the website for other users to listen to, and for the performer (if a performance is in progress) to use as material for musical improvisation.</li>
        <li>When you begin sharing, your approximate location will also be shared on the website. A point will appear on the map with a wider radius of your location such that your position within a city cannot be determined.</li>
        <li>Extracted sound features that are streamed to the website will be archived in a database to be re-sonified in later performances.</li>
        <li>Participation is completely anonymous so once data has been streamed it cannot be retrieved or erased from the database. </li>
        <li>At any moment you cant hit 'Stop Sharing' to remove your position from the map and stop streaming sound features to the website. </li>
      </ul>
