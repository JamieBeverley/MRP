# Precipitate

Precipitate is a web installation and performance that explores the acoustic qualities of weather through machine listening and re-sonification.
People anywhere in the world are invited to lend their smartphones to extract sonic features from the weather in their local environment and listen to re-sonifications of that data. During a performance of Precipitate, live-streamed sound features will be used as material for musical improvisation performed in front of a live audience.
