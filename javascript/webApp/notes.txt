microsound - Curtis R
'boundaries of randomness' - evolving to noise, back to coherence
Truax - 'River Run' 1987 - grains opening wide enough to noise and back

'random range' - 'here are the 10 closest grains, pick one randomly from it' - opposed to 'this is close enough but there could be 30 000 more grains'
 - are there more efficient algorithms that would allow this


corpus reduction on phones?
 - get rid of redundant grains


'density/volume' - difference between multichannel vs. stereo - # of sound events an important control (esp for granular synthesis)
 - needs controlled differently for stereo vs. multichannel



June 26:
 - decide on some computations
   - reweighting
   - randomness/tolerance of grain
   - sample and hold
   - corpus selection
   - toggle on/off?
   - sequence on/off?
 - what are global controls, will they interact at all with the computations
 - write nodejs ws server to connect to performance client
 - figure out how DAG will be constructed on SC side
 - what things do supercollider need to tell the browser?
   - available corpuses
 - make remote client (lol)


- Connection.connections tells SC of the shape/state of connections
- individual Connectables report their changing values differently with reference to their uid and type
